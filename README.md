# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This project is based on the starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

##  Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Feautures Added
1. Pause Button - spacebar can be pressed to pause the game at any time
2. Configuratble window and grid size: edit WindowDims.txt in souce to edit the window and grid size. The window size should be an integer multipl of the screen size
3. 

## Ruberic Points

### Loop/IO
1. Projects Reads Data from a file - See utils.h / utils.cpp, WindowDims.txt\
2. Project Accepts user input and processes the input - Spacebar pauses the game (controller.cpp lines ?-?)

### OOP
1.
2. use Member intiialization list - the overload of the Renderer constructor I defined  
3. Overloaded the render function for a quare window, accepting only 2 parameters

### Memory Management
1. The Project makes use of references in function declarations - Added the bool & paused as an argument to Controller::HandleInput, Controller::
2.
3.

### Concurrency
1.
2.
